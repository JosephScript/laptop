# laptop

Some crazy script based on [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) for installation of all my dev stuff. There's a lot here, more than in the base project. 

Uses `brew`, `brew cask`, `npm`. Also sets up oh-my-zsh for a sexier shell.

## Installation

```
sh laptop.sh
```
